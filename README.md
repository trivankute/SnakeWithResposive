# SnakeWithResposive
One of my first projects, this is a very specical snake game, made totally by myself in one night with no any guidance but only from my basic javascript, HTML and CSS
i had learnt before. This is still a very basic game, made with simple HTML and CSS. In some kinds of computers's screen might triggered block's bugs caused by the
difference of screen resolution, which may be different from my laptop's resolution. I found it when gave the snake to my friends to test and in my friend's laptop,
the blocks is broken. And i don't know how to debug, i should've coded it in canvas huhu T-T.
Some special features i've added to my snake is the ability to choose how many apples in the game and the responsive form for playing on small gadgets such as 
smartphones and tablets.
